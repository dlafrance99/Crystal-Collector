# Crystal Collector Game

The Crystal Collector Game is a simple game that gives four different colored crystals, different values that the user should use to add up to the target number. The values of the crystals are randomly generated and not known to the user. the target number is also randomly generated. If the user gets the target number exactly, they will be alerted they won. If they go over the target number, they'll be alerted that they lost.
